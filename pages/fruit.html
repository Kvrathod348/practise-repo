            <p class="text1"> <b>Apples are high in fiber, vitamin C, and various antioxidants. They are also very
                    filling,
                    considering their low calorie count.
                    Studies show that eating apples can have multiple benefits for your health.
                    Usually eaten raw, apples can also be used in various recipes, juices, and drinks.</b>

            <p class="text2"><b>A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several
                    kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries,
                    bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas.
